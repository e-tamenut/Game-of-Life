# Conway's Game of Life - Pygame Implementation

This is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton where cells evolve based on simple rules. The game is visualized using Pygame, allowing interaction and experimentation with different initial configurations.

### Features:
- **Grid visualization**: The grid is drawn with cells that can be toggled on/off with mouse clicks.
- **Random generation**: Press the 'g' key to generate a random starting configuration.
- **Pause/Play**: Toggle the simulation state with the spacebar.
- **Clear**: Press the 'c' key to clear the grid and reset the simulation.
- **Adjustable speed**: The speed of the simulation can be modified by adjusting the update frequency.

### Controls:
- **Click**: Toggle cells on/off.
- **Space**: Pause/Resume the simulation.
- **C**: Clear the grid.
- **G**: Generate a random configuration.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (`pip install pygame`)

### How to Run:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   `pip install pygame`
3. Run the script:
   `python main.py`while in the corresponding directory 

Enjoy experimenting with various configurations and see how the patterns evolve!
